# Terminal Continue Monitor - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The Terminal Continue Monitor is a Python-based automation tool designed to monitor Windows terminal applications (Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal) for periods of inactivity and automatically send "continue" commands to maintain session activity.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Terminal Detection
- The system shall automatically detect and monitor instances of Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell (powershell.exe), and Windows Terminal (WindowsTerminal.exe)
- The system shall dynamically add newly opened terminal windows to the monitoring list
- The system shall gracefully handle terminal windows that are closed during monitoring

### FR-002: Activity Monitoring
- The system shall continuously monitor the visible text content of each terminal window
- The system shall use hash-based comparison for efficient text change detection
- The system shall track the timestamp of the last detected change for each monitored window
- The system shall support configurable inactivity threshold periods (default: 30 seconds)

### FR-003: Automated Response
- The system shall send the command "continue" followed by Enter key to windows that exceed the inactivity threshold
- The system shall reset the inactivity timer after sending the command to prevent repeated triggers
- The system shall handle cases where the target window becomes unresponsive or unavailable

### FR-004: Configuration Management
- The system shall support configurable target process names
- The system shall support configurable inactivity threshold duration
- The system shall support configurable polling interval
- The system shall support configurable keystroke commands
- All configuration shall be externalized to a configuration file

### FR-005: Logging and Monitoring
- The system shall log all significant events including window detection, inactivity detection, and command execution
- The system shall provide structured logging with appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- The system shall handle and log exceptions gracefully without terminating the monitoring process
- The system shall provide startup and shutdown logging

### FR-006: Error Handling and Resilience
- The system shall continue monitoring even if individual window operations fail
- The system shall recover from temporary system access issues
- The system shall provide graceful shutdown on user interruption (Ctrl+C)
- The system shall restart monitoring loops after unexpected exceptions with appropriate delays

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- The system shall operate with minimal CPU usage during normal monitoring operations
- The monitoring loop shall not exceed 5% CPU usage during steady-state operation
- Hash-based text comparison shall be used to minimize memory and processing overhead

### NFR-002: Reliability
- The system shall operate continuously for extended periods without manual intervention
- The system shall handle system sleep/wake cycles appropriately
- The system shall manage memory usage to prevent memory leaks during long-running operation

### NFR-003: Usability
- The system shall provide clear console output indicating current operational status
- The system shall display configuration settings at startup
- The system shall provide clear instructions for starting and stopping the monitor

### NFR-004: Maintainability
- The code shall be well-documented with inline comments explaining complex operations
- The system shall use modular design with separation of concerns
- Configuration shall be externalized and easily modifiable
- The system shall include comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting

### NFR-005: Security
- The system shall operate with minimal required Windows permissions
- The system shall not store or transmit sensitive terminal content
- Hash-based content comparison shall ensure privacy of terminal text

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Platform Support
- The system shall run on Windows 10 and Windows 11
- The system shall support both 32-bit and 64-bit Python installations
- The system shall be compatible with Python 3.8 and higher

### TR-002: Dependencies
- The system shall use pywinauto library for Windows UI automation
- The system shall use pywin32 library for Windows API access
- The system shall minimize external dependencies to reduce installation complexity

### TR-003: Packaging and Distribution
- The system shall include a requirements.txt file for dependency management
- The system shall include installation scripts for easy setup
- The system shall provide clear documentation for manual installation

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- The system is designed specifically for Windows operating systems
- The system requires appropriate Windows permissions for UI automation
- The system depends on Windows UI Automation accessibility features

### Assumptions
- Target terminal applications support standard Windows UI automation
- Users have Python installation capabilities on their systems
- Users understand basic terminal/command line operations
- The system will be used in environments where automated "continue" commands are appropriate and desired
