## Priority Breakdown

### High Priority (Must Have - Minimum Viable Product)
1. **Core Application Development** - All items in Stage 3
2. **Configuration and Setup** - requirements.txt, config.example.yaml, .gitignore
3. **Basic Error Handling** - Exception handling in main monitoring loop
4. **Repository Setup** - Git initialization and GitHub repository creation

### Medium Priority (Should Have - Enhanced Functionality)
1. **Utility Modules** - Modular design implementation from Stage 4
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - All items in Stage 5
3. **Logging Infrastructure** - Structured logging and monitoring from Stage 6
4. **Basic Testing** - Unit and integration tests for core functionality

### Low Priority (Nice to Have - Future Enhancements)
1. **Advanced Testing** - Performance and load testing
2. **Comprehensive Documentation** - API docs and user manuals
3. **Distribution Packaging** - Installers and standalone executables
4. **Docker Support** - Containerization options
